#Team Profile Generator

1. Write HTML and CSS.
2. Create JavaScript classes for Employee, Engineer, Intern, and Manager.
3. Link script and CSS in HTML.
   --Require npms and other js files in index.js.
4. Create a function to initialize the app (a prompt to prompt the prompts?).
5. Create inquirer prompts to add team members of each class, starting with Manager.
6. Create a menu to appear after each user entry in the terminal, asking if we want to add another of the classes, or are we done.
7. Send user input to the cards in the HTML file.
   -Use HTML <p><a href="mailto:someone@example.com"></a></p> for each entry's email address. ("WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
   THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address")
   -Also "WHEN I click on the GitHub username
   THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab."
8. Create tests for each class.
